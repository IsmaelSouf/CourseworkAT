Advanced Web Technologies Coursework.

You may use any other technologies as appropriate in addition within your virtual server. If you have requirements that cannot be satisfied using just your VM them talk to the module leader about your plans in advance. You may use additional Python modules, Flask plugins, Javascript Libraries, or miscellaneous software in the production of your project. However you must be able to justify why you used additional software rather than writing a solution yourself.
